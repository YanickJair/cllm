It looks like I was billed twice for the same subscription.\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear that, let\u2019s take a look together. Can I have your account email or billing ID to verify your record?\nCustomer: Sure, it\u2019s melissa.jordan@example.com.\nAgent: Thanks, Melissa. Give me just a moment... alright, I can see two transactions on your file \u2014 one processed on the 2nd and another on the 3rd. It seems the system retried payment even after the first one succeeded.\nCustomer: Oh wow, that explains it. So I\u2019m not crazy then.\nAgent: Not at all. It\u2019s a known issue we had earlier this week with duplicate processing. The good news is, you\u2019re eligible for a full refund on the second charge.\nCustomer: Great. How long will it take to show up?\nAgent: Once I file the refund, it usually reflects within 3\u20135 business days depending on your bank. I\u2019ll also send you a confirmation email with the reference number.\nCustomer: That works. Thank you for sorting it out so quickly.\nAgent: My pleasure. I\u2019ve just submitted the refund request now \u2014 your reference number is RFD-908712. You should see that update later today.\nCustomer: Perfect. I appreciate your help, Raj.\nAgent: Anytime! Is there anything else I can check for you today?\nCustomer: No, that\u2019s all. Thanks again!\nAgent: Thank you for calling us, Melissa.
