Subject: [Foundever validated] Cut your LLM costs by 50-70%

Hi [Name],

Quick question: Are you spending $XX,XXX/month on LLM APIs?

I built CLLM at Foundever (170K employees) - a compression system that 
reduces LLM costs by 50-70% with zero quality loss.

Validated results:
• 67.6% token reduction ✓
• 93% quality retention ✓
• $30-46M/year potential savings ✓

Looking for 10 design partners to use CLLM free for 3 months in 
exchange for feedback and a case study.

Open to a 20-min demo this week?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Technical benchmarks: [attach BENCHMARK_ANALYSIS.txt]

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Should I quit my job now?**
A: Not yet! Build MVP nights/weekends, get design partners, then decide. Having income reduces risk.

**Q: How much equity should I give away?**
A: Seed: 15-20%, Series A: 20-25%. You'll own ~30-40% at exit.

**Q: What if OpenAI/Anthropic release compression?**
A: Your patent + domain expertise + network effects + faster iteration = still win.

**Q: How long until I make money?**
A: Personal income: keep day job initially. Company profitability: Month 18-24.

**Q: What's realistic exit value?**
A: $100-300M acquisition in 5-7 years if execution is strong.
