Agent: Good morning, thank you for calling TechCorp support. My name is Sarah. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Sarah, I’ve been having issues with my internet connection for the past three days. It keeps dropping every few hours, and I work from home so this is really frustrating.

Agent: I totally understand how important that is. Let’s get this sorted. Could I have your account number, please?

Customer: Sure, it’s 847-392-1045.

Agent: Thanks. I see you’re on the Premium 500 plan. When the connection drops, do all your devices lose internet, or just one?

Customer: Everything — my laptop, my wife’s phone, even the TV.

Agent: Got it. I’m running a quick diagnostic on your modem… okay, it looks like a line fluctuation issue in your area. We’ve had similar reports from nearby addresses.

Customer: So it’s not just me?

Agent: Correct. A technician is already assigned to inspect the local node this afternoon. I’ve added your account to that ticket so you’ll be notified once it’s resolved.

Customer: Great. Will I need to reboot anything?

Agent: Once service stabilizes, just unplug your modem for 30 seconds and plug it back in. That will refresh your connection.

Customer: Perfect. Thanks for the help.

Agent: Hello, this is Daniel from MobileWave billing. How can I help you today?

Customer: Hi Daniel, I was charged twice for my plan this month. I only have one line, so I’m not sure why.

Agent: I see how that’s confusing. Let’s check it out. What’s your account ID?

Customer: MW-55983.

Agent: Thanks. I see two identical payments for $89.99 — one on the 2nd and one on the 4th. Looks like a duplicate authorization error.

Customer: Can that be fixed?

Agent: Yes, I’m submitting a refund request right now. You’ll see the refund within 3–5 business days. I’ll also apply a $10 courtesy credit for the inconvenience.

Customer: Wow, thanks so much.

Agent: My pleasure. Anything else I can assist with today?

Customer: Hey, Michael. My internet’s been cutting out randomly for the last week. It disconnects, then comes back after a few minutes. It’s driving me crazy.

Agent: I’m really sorry about that. Let’s take a deeper look. Can I have your account number?

Customer: Sure, it’s 154882. Address is 41 Riverbend Lane.

Agent: Thanks, found your account. You’re on the Fiber 1 Gbps plan. I see multiple drop events in the last 72 hours. Are you using a personal router or our company router?

Customer: I’m using your router, the one with the white antenna.

Agent: Got it. Can I ask if the lights on the router go red when it disconnects?

Customer: Yeah, it flashes red for a few seconds, then goes back to blue.

Agent: That’s a signal issue. It’s usually the optical line, not your devices. I’ll test your fiber link remotely… okay, the signal strength is below threshold intermittently.

Customer: So what does that mean?

Agent: It means the fiber cable connection outside your home might be slightly bent or dirty. I’ll schedule a technician to clean and re-terminate it. The next available slot is tomorrow morning between 9 and 11.

Customer: That works. Do I need to be home?

Agent: It’s best if you are, just in case they need indoor access. Also, I recommend avoiding frequent reboots tonight — it can worsen the signal calibration.

Customer: Got it. Thanks for the thorough explanation.

Agent: You’re very welcome. Once fixed, you’ll get a text confirmation and a feedback survey.

Customer: Sure, it’s emily.thomas@icloud.com.

Agent: Thanks. I see you recently upgraded from Standard to Premium. The $14.99 was for your old plan, and the $16.99 is for the new one. The overlap happened because the upgrade occurred mid-billing cycle.

Customer: So I was charged twice for the same month?

Agent: In a sense, yes — a partial overlap. But don’t worry, I can refund the difference. I’ll also adjust your billing cycle so this won’t happen again.

Customer: That would be great. I’ve been a customer for years, so I was surprised.
