Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because you're likely spending $XX,XXX/month on LLM APIs (Claude, GPT, etc.), and I can help you cut that by 50-70% without any quality loss.

I built CLLM at Foundever (170K employees) where we validated:
• 67.6% token reduction
• 93% quality retention  
• $30-46M/year potential savings

Looking for 10 design partners to use CLLM free for 3 months in exchange for feedback and a case study.

## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Should I quit Foundever now?**
A: Not yet. Build MVP nights/weekends, get design partners, then decide. Having income reduces risk.

**Q: Do I need a co-founder?**
A: Not immediately. Get to MVP + customers first, then evaluate. Technical + business skills are ideal.

**Q: How much equity should I give up?**
A: Seed: 15-20%, Series A: 20-25%. Total dilution to exit: 60-70% is normal.

**Q: What if LLM providers add compression?**
A: Your patent is defensive. Plus you'll have:
- Network effects (shared vocabularies)
- Domain expertise (custom compressions)
- Faster iteration (focused product)

**Q: What's the exit strategy?**
A: Strategic acquisition most likely:
- Anthropic/OpenAI (add to platform)
- Salesforce/Zendesk (add to products)
- Private equity (cash flow business)
Target: $100-300M in 5-7 years
